Vicidial-Hangup-Mouseclick-Automation-


This script is designed to automate the process of mouseclicks during a call with a customer. This script allows the sales agent to press only one button on the keyboard and all clicks (hangup, reason for hangup and call next customer in the list) will be clicked automatically, making the calling process more efficient.
Requirements

    AutoIt and AutoItX library needs to be installed on the system.
    Windows OS

How to Use

    Download the script and place it in the desired location on your system.
    Open the script in AutoIt and adjust the coordinates of the mouse clicks to match the positions of the buttons on your screen.
    Run the script and make sure that the Vicidial application is open and active.
    Press the hotkeys {END}, {ENTER}, {NUMPAD0}, {NUMPADSUB} to trigger the corresponding functions.

Hotkeys

    {END} - Exit the script
    {ENTER} - Mark the call as not reached
    {NUMPAD0} - Mark the call as no connection
    {NUMPADSUB} - Mark the call as do not call

Troubleshooting

If the script is not working as expected, check that the coordinates of the mouse clicks are correct.
